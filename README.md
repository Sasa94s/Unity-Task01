# Unity-Task01
Create a 3D shape generator program. The user sees a cube in black in the center when the program starts. There are two controls on the screen and a button. The first allows him to change the shape between cube, sphere, and cone. The other allows the user to change the color of the shape. Once he is happy with the shape he pushes the button to "save" it which results in a small copy of that shape getting created and placed somewhere else on the screen in a list (or grid). The user can then continue to customize the main shape and save more instances that go into the same list.
